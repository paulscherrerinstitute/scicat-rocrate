### Scicat-Datacite mapping via OWL equivalence
[scicat-merged-export.ttl](src/main/resources/scicat-merged-export.ttl) contains the result of loading [the schema](../scicat-types/published-data.jsonld) and the [instance](../ro-crate-metadata.json) in a single Turtle file (Generated by loading the [merged jsonld](../ro-crate-merged.jsonld) in Protege and saving as Turtle/RDF, after changing `scicat:creator` from AnnotationProperty to ObjectProperty).

This demo shows that the [OWL Reasoner](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/#owl) from Apache Jena is able to make sense of the equivalence between `scicat:creator` and `datacite:creatorName` (defined in the source turtle file), enabling us to query based on terms from the datacite ontology. 

#### Output
We create an InferenceModel from the Turtle file, and list all statements (asserted + inferred) with <http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4#creatorName> as the predicate. Although the statement is present with `scicat:creator` in the source Turtle file, the inference model uses the equivalence and produces the following output: 
```
Subject | Predicate | Object:
 - (<https://doi.psi.ch/detail/10.16907%2F00b95267-8b8b-48a7-8de6-8da6b9b7bb7d> <http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4#creatorName> <http://scicat-schema.psi.ch/Matthias>)
```
